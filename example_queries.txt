NOTES FOR IMPLEMENTATION
-------------------------

When implementing the chatbot:
1. For data-driven questions, compute statistics server-side and include in context
2. For model questions, load metrics from model_metrics.json
3. For general questions, rely on Gemini's knowledge but provide dataset-specific context when relevant
4. Always cite specific numbers/features when answering data-driven questions
5. If a question requires data that isn't available, the chatbot should say so clearly

Example context string format:
```
